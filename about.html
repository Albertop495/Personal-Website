            <h1 id="h1">About Me</h1>
            <p id="p1"><u>My name is Alberto Perez Vidal. I am a Mexican-American student going to school in Harlem, New York.  I am a very hardworking student and I do very well in school and working with others. I one day hope to go into the field of engineering, more specifically into civil or aerospace engineering. I developed my goal of going into the field of engineering during my junior year of high school when I took AP Calculus and Physics and realized how much I would love to plan, design, and supervise the construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects while taking into account the effects of an environment around it. <u>
