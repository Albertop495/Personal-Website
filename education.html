I have been on the honor roll top 10 for every semester I have completed. I am also in the National Honor Society and currently hold a 4.0 GPA. This school doesnâ€™t offer many AP classes and I have taken most of them. I play for the soccer and lacrosse teams for this school. I am in the engineering academy and take most of the stem courses offered at this school
